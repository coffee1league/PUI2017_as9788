and the plot made by mms991 contained here:

1. I will begin by providing a review of the first plot by nj935.  This plot visualized restaurant 
sanitation scores grouped by seasons (Summer, Winter, Spring, Fall )  and grouped by types of cuisine served (American, Chinese, Pizza, etc), 

The type of plot utilized was a pie chart. The innovative part of the plot is that it saught to 
catergorize poor sanitation scroes by season as well types of food as this might lead to conclusions around seasons. The author indeed concludes in his remarks that based on the four season coparision, summer tends to ahave  greatest number f pooor sanitation gades for American cuisine esablishments. 
However, the difficulty with reading pie chart plots is that it is difficult to compare seasons to one another visually given the different color schemes and diffficulty in comparing diferent sized slices to each other. Perhaps an alternative way to compare sanitation scores across different seasons was through a line graph ( each line could represent a type of food ), or through a histograph. The author additionally posted a histograph of raw score counts which to some extent made it easier to compare however given that the total counts are different across seasons perhaps a fractional score or a percentage would have been a good way to standardie the comparison across time.  The pie chart is clearly labeled however since the color coding changes in each pie chart to represent the highest to least porportion of the total, it may confuse a hurried reader as they may think that the color might correspond to types of cuisine. 

2. Review of plot by mms991: This plot summarizes the number and type of issues that occured in NYC Parks in 2016. The bar graph is clear and uses consisten color codes based on the category of complaints or issues. The plot has a clear title, and the axis are clearly labeled with units. The X axis provides labels for the different parks and since the bar graphs are plotted on the same axis it is straight forward to compare them against each other visually. Overall, the plot is sized well and visually clear. One idea for a future graph might be to plot the complaint as a porportion or percentage of the total number of complaints per park in order to be able to compare the measures. Overall a great plot.
