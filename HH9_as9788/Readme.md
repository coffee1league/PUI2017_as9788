and the plot made by xx contained here:

.

I will begin by providing a review of the frist plost by nj935.  This plot visualized restaurant 
sanitation scores grouped by seasons (Summer, Winter, Spring, Fall )  and grouped by types of cuisine served (American, Chinese, Pizza, etc), 
The type of plot utilized is a pie chart. The innovative part of the plot is that it saught to 
catergorize poor sanitation scroes by season as well types of food as this might lead to conclusions around seasons. The author indeed concludes in his remarks that based on the four season coparision, summer tends to ahave  greatest number f pooor sanitation gades for American cuisine esablishments. 
However, the difficulty with reading pie chartplots is that it is difficult to compare seasons to one another visually given the different color schemes and diffficulty in comparing diferent sized slices to each other.
