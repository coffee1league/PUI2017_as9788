For this assignment  I was asked to review the  plots made by nj935  contained here

and the plot made by mms991 contained here:

.

I will begin by providing a review of the first plot by nj935.  This plot visualized restaurant 
sanitation scores grouped by seasons (Summer, Winter, Spring, Fall )  and grouped by types of cuisine served (American, Chinese, Pizza, etc), 
The type of plot utilized was a pie chart. The innovative part of the plot is that it saught to 
catergorize poor sanitation scroes by season as well types of food as this might lead to conclusions around seasons. The author indeed concludes in his remarks that based on the four season coparision, summer tends to ahave  greatest number f pooor sanitation gades for American cuisine esablishments. 
However, the difficulty with reading pie chart plots is that it is difficult to compare seasons to one another visually given the different color schemes and diffficulty in comparing diferent sized slices to each other. Perhaps an alternative way to compare sanitation scores across different seasons was through a line graph ( each line could represent a type of food ), or through a histograph. The author additionally posted a histograph of raw score counts which to some extent made it easier to compare however given that the total counts are different across seasons perhaps a fractional score or a percentage would have been a good way to standardie the comparison across time.
