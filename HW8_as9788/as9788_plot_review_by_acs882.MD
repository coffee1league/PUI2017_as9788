REVIEW

CLARITY:
Once an understanding of the context of the plot is grasped, it is highly effective in what it sets out to do - it's very visual, and displays muiltiple dimensions (kW capacity, concentration of available locations) intuitively. That said, it is not apparent, likely to the highly-niche subject area on which it focuses, at the outset what the plot is doing. There are no labels on the plot (it appears to be a screenshot of a Catro-generated map, so I get why, but a bit more formatting could have gone a long way). That said, a clear description is provided, and once you've read this, it makes sense. 

ESTHETIC:
I think it's a good lookin' graph. All elements are functional and clear - is this not beauty? I think the decision to express concentration by using darker shades of blue is a sound one; I could see trying to do this in different colors getting messy very quickly. The particular screenshot shown here could do well to include more labels of neighborhoods, but this is Carto's problem, not Ana's, and when you go to the actual graph (link at the bottom of the page!), you can zoom in and out as you please. 

HONESTY: 
It's an honest plot - nothing to hide here! Seems to convey roughly the same information as you zoom in and out as well, so no deceptions here, unless I'm a huge sucker and am missing something. 

POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENTS:
I think the biggest improvement that could be made is clear labeling. I'm not sure how possible this is with Carto, but the initial impression of the plot was "What's this?" Until I read the information above and my reaction changed to "Ooohhh." Again, it's hard with such a niche subject, but some labels more involved on the graph (or the screenshot of the graph) would help ease that initial confusion.

Hope this is helpful!!!

ORIGINAL TEXT PROVIDED WITH GRAPHIC

The data describe available rooftop space for solar from LiDAR data collected for New York City for a subset of buildings.

Because the data set includes latitude and longitude (location), a map based visualization might be useful for a policy maker

or community group interested in selecting a site. The open data site already offers a map of all the locations in this data set.

So in order to differentiate, I selected to map the points in various sizes tied to the estimated roof solar capacity in kw.

In addition to varying point size, I also elected to use a heavier color for denser concentration of points so that it's easier to differentiate.

The idea being that at first glance, one might see where is the greatest concentration of available rooftoop space ordered by solar capacity.

Enjoy!
