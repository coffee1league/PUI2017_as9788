2. Review of plot by mms991: This plot summarizes the number and type of issues that occured in NYC Parks in 2016. The bar graph is clear and uses consisten color codes based on the category of complaints or issues. The plot has a clear title, and the axis are clearly labeled with units. The X axis provides labels for the different parks and since the bar graphs are plotted on the same axis it is straight forward to compare them against each other visually. Overall, the plot is sized well and visually clear. One idea for a future graph might be to plot the complaint as a porportion or percentage of the total number of complaints per park in order to be able to compare the measures. Overall a great plot.
