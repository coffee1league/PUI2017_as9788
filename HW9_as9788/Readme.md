HW 9 comprised of two parts including: 

Part 1: Plot review for two classmates 

Part 2: Plotting LinkNYC location on top on the broadband access data for NYC. The idea being is if we could assess if the LinkNYC 
pods/towers are providing service to the areas where broadband access is not fully available. 

This assginment included working with PUMA data from the Census in order to get granular data for broadband access in NYC.

It also included working with LinkNYC locations data and creating a geometry based on long and lat points in order to plot these on 
top of the shapefile containing broadband access data in 5 groups. The five groups allow for an easier visual understanding of 
where boradband access is comprehensive and where it is lacking.

The next step was to divide the PUMA data per 100 people areas and replot. In order to do this one of the requirmeents were to reproject 
the LinkNYC and broadband access shapefile. The broadband access shapefile was reprojected however the LinkNYC issues a runtime error. 

In the midst of debugging this piece. 

Collaboration on this with jlk635, the Prof as well as the TA and Stackoverflow.
